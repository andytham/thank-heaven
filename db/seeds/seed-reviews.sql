With so many mom & pop stores in Forest Hills folding under pressure of high rents and competition from big-box and online retailers, the store is a breath of fresh air! The owner is so helpful, knows her customers and their kids and is lovely to talk to. I have bought countless items from clothing and shoes to toys and books for my own children and as gifts. The quality merchandise and personal service is unparalleled. She also carries many unique items that you can''t find easily elsewhere. My daughter also loves sitting at the table and doing puzzles in the store while I browse. Love this place!','Stefanie B.','New York');

There are many places I can go, but I chose Thank Heaven for two main reasons. The quality and uniqueness of the clothes and toys but most importantly because of the owner. Aside from always going out of her way, Ariena is one of the most trustworthy shop owners I have met. I highly recommend this store and don''t believe any negative reviews.','Natka M.','New York');
